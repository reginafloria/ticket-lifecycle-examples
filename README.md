<p>SLA's (Service Level Agreements) are used to prioritize incoming tickets. An SLA is an agreement which
describes the urgency in which a ticket must be resolved.  In this case. the ticket has been assigned to
John, at Sev-B. Sev-B means that John has a 4 hour window in which to resolve the issue.
